# AP Networking Portfolio

This year, I am also taking AP Networking, in which I have been learning about network setups, protocols, and data transmission while configuring devices like switches, routers, and firewalls. Through hands-on labs and real-world scenarios, I have built skills in troubleshooting, optimizing performance, and implementing security.
